In this project, I implemented a deep Q-Learning agent to play this Treasure Hunt Maze. The objective for the agent is to find a way to the other side of an 8x8 grid filled with obsticles where the "treasure" has been placed. Without giving the agent the solution, we allow it to undergo reinforcement learning and itterate over the game for 1000 epochs to learn the optimal route across the board to the treasure. In this project, I only implemented the Q-Learning agent located in the Jupiter Notebook file. Other boiler plate code for the execution of the game was provided to me.
